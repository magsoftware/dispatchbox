## Always on

### Formatting Rules

- Use proper heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Use code blocks with language tags for code examples
- Use backticks for inline code and file names
- Use lists for multiple items
- Use tables for structured data
- Keep line length reasonable (max 120 characters)

### Code Blocks

- Always specify language for code blocks
- Use triple backticks with language identifier
- Example: ` ```python ` for Python code

### Links

- Use descriptive link text
- Prefer relative paths for internal links
- Use absolute URLs for external links
